# üöÄ EXACTLY WHAT TO DO NOW - DEPLOYMENT CONTINUATION

## üìä CURRENT SITUATION
Due to the rate limiting message you received earlier, we need to continue the deployment of our genomics repositories. The repositories are prepared and ready for GitHub deployment.

## üéØ STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS

### STEP 1: Run Fixed Verification Script
```tcsh
cd /home/sdodl001
./github_deployment_complete.csh
```
This will verify the repository status and should now correctly count the commits.

### STEP 2: GitHub Repository Creation (ONE-TIME MANUAL STEP)
You need to create 5 GitHub repositories under your `SanjeevaRDodlapati` account:

1. **Visit: https://github.com/new**

2. **Create each repository (one by one):**

   a. **Meta-repository**
   - Repository name: `genomics-workspace`
   - Description: "Enterprise genomics research workspace with coordinated CI/CD"
   - Public repository
   - DO NOT initialize with any files
   - Click "Create repository"
   
   b. **Project repositories** (repeat for each)
   - Repository names: `UAVarPrior`, `GenomicLightning`, `FuGEP`, `TransMet`
   - Description: "Advanced genomics research project - part of coordinated workspace"
   - Public repository
   - DO NOT initialize with any files
   - Click "Create repository"

**IMPORTANT**: All 5 repositories are created SEPARATELY at the GitHub root level (they are NOT nested)

### STEP 3: Deployment Execution
After creating all 5 repositories on GitHub, run:

```tcsh
cd /home/sdodl001
./execute_github_deployment.csh
```

This script will:
- Push all local repositories to GitHub
- Configure the submodule relationships in the meta-repository

### STEP 4: First Coordinated Release
After the deployment is complete, create the initial v0.1.0 release across all projects:

```tcsh
./execute_first_release.csh
```

### STEP 5: Deploy Monitoring
Finally, deploy the monitoring infrastructure:

```tcsh
./deploy_monitoring.csh
```

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

**If any repository push fails:**
1. Check if the GitHub repository exists and is empty
2. Verify SSH authentication works with:
   ```tcsh
   ssh -T git@github-sanjeevar
   ```
   Should show: "Hi SanjeevaRDodlapati! You've successfully authenticated..."
3. Try pushing manually:
   ```tcsh
   cd /home/sdodl001/UAVarPrior
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME
After completing these steps, you will have:
- All 5 repositories on GitHub
- The meta-repository (genomics-workspace) with all 4 projects as submodules
- v0.1.0 release tags across all repositories
- Comprehensive monitoring infrastructure deployed

This will complete the implementation of your enterprise-grade Git organization system across all genomics research repositories.
